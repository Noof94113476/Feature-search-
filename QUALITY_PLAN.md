## ðŸ”¸ (a) Quality Plan â€“ McCallâ€™s Model

### âœ… Criterion 1: Correctness
- **Definition:** Measures the degree to which the software correctly implements the specified functional requirements.
- **How to Achieve:**
  - Clearly document all functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Perform functional testing to verify accurate outputs.
  - Use code reviews and unit testing to ensure code correctness.
- **Practical Example:** In our project, ensure the search functionality returns correct results when a keyword is entered and covers all departments.

### âœ… Criterion 2: Usability
- **Definition:** Measures the ease with which end users can use the system.
- **How to Achieve:**
  - Design a user-friendly interface compatible with various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  - Conduct usability testing with real users.
  - Simplify the interface to minimize steps.
- **Practical Example:** Design a simple search page with clear fields and buttons for easy searching.

## ðŸ”¸ (b) Defect Density Calculation

- **Definition:** Defect Density = Number of defects per 1,000 lines of code.
- **Formula:**
- Defect Density = (Number of Defects / Lines of Code (LOC)) * 1000
- - **Example:**  
Number of defects: 3  
Lines of code: 150  
Calculation:
Defect Density = (3 / 150) * 1000 = 20 defects per KLOC
Result: Lower defect density = higher quality.
